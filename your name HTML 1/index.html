          According to a statistics, every 5 seconds a child dies as a result of
          hunger. Before you complain about the taste of your food, think of
          someone who has nothing to eat at all. We get the food easily, so we
          waste it without realizing for a minute. Let's make it a habit of
          giving the left overs to the hunger every night before we fall asleep.
